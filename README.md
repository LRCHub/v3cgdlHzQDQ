[00:14.50] Happiness hit her
[00:17.74] Like a train on a track
[00:27.32] Coming towards her
[00:30.87] Stuck, still no turning back
[00:44.87] 
[00:39.01] She hid around corners
[00:42.03] And she hid under beds
[00:45.22] She killed it with kisses
[00:48.53] And from it she fled
[00:58.53] 
[00:51.81] With every bubble
[00:54.64] She sank with her drink
[00:58.28] And washed it away down
[01:01.40] The kitchen sink
[01:09.40] 
[01:04.78] The dog days are over
[01:07.98] The dog days are done
[01:11.15] The horses are coming
[01:13.84] So you better run
[01:22.34] 
[01:17.49] Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
[01:20.94] Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
[01:24.11] Leave all your love and your longing behind
[01:26.89] You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
[01:51.89] 
[01:30.35] The dog days are over
[01:33.32] The dog days are done
[01:36.92] Can you hear the horses?
[01:39.74] 'Cause here are they come
[01:52.24] 
[01:49.18] And I never wanted anything from you
[02:01.44] Except everything
[02:06.98] You had and what was left after that too, oh
[02:28.98] 
[02:16.15] Happiness hit her
[02:19.34] Like a bullet in the back
[02:28.59] Struck from a great height
[02:32.59] By someone who should know better than that
[02:54.09] 
[02:40.75] The dog days are over
[02:43.94] The dog days are done
[02:47.31] Can you hear the horses?
[02:50.13] 'Cause here they come
[03:00.63] 
[03:06.16] Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
[03:09.75] Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
[03:12.95] Leave all your love and your longing behind
[03:15.60] You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
[03:40.60] 
[03:19.16] The dog days are over
[03:22.10] The dog days are done
[03:25.79] Can you hear the horses?
[03:28.56] 'Cause here are they come
[03:41.06] 
[03:30.98] The dog days are over
[03:35.37] The dog days are done
[03:36.52] The horses are coming
[03:42.82] So you better run
[03:43.27] Here they come
[03:50.27] 
[03:48.16] The dog days are over
[03:49.04] The dog days are done
[03:50.76] The horses are coming
[04:00.71] So you better run
